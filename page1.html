  <p>Tor is an effective tool for protecting user anonymity online. It has been shown to be resilient against attempts to compromise it, even by powerful adversaries like the NSA. Tor is used by a diverse range of people, including activists, the military, families, and journalists.</p>

  <p>Despite initial funding from the US Navy, Tor is an open-source project with no known military backdoors. Operating a Tor relay is believed to be legal under US law.</p>

  <p>Tor is designed to be user-friendly, with tools like Tor Browser Bundle and Tails making it easy to get started. Speed improvements have been made in recent years, and developers continue to work on making Tor faster.</p>

  <p>However, Tor is not foolproof. Users can compromise their anonymity if they use it incorrectly. It is important to use the recommended tools and to keep software up to date. Users should also be aware of potential risks, such as logging into identifiable services over Tor.</p>

  <p>Overall, Tor is a valuable tool for people who want to protect their online privacy. It is effective, accessible, and legal. However, it is important to use it correctly to avoid compromising your anonymity.</p>
